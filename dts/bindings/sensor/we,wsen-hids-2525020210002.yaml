    Würth Elektronik WSEN-HIDS-2525020210002 humidity sensor

compatible: "we,wsen-hids-2525020210002"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:

  precision:
    type: string
    default: "Medium"
    enum:
      - "Low"
      - "Medium"
      - "High"
    description: |
      Sensor measurement precision for temperature and humidity.
      Supported precision options are Low, Medium or High.
      Defaults to Medium, which is a good compromise between
      current usage and precision.

  heater:
    type: string
    default: "Off"
    enum:
      - "Off"
      - "On_200mW_1s"
      - "On_200mW_100ms"
      - "On_110mW_1s"
      - "On_110mW_100ms"
      - "On_20mW_1s"
      - "On_20mW_100ms"
    description: |
      Activate the heater when fetching a sample for the specified amount of time.
      This is only possible when the precison is set to high.
      Defaults to Off, since this option is valid for high precision
      and the default precision is medium.
